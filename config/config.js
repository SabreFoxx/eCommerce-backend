/*
Now when the application terminates, it gracefully closes the database connection
before it ends.
Similarly, when nodemon restarts the application due to changes in the
source files, the application closes the current database connection first. The nodemon
listener is using process.once as opposed to process.on, as you want to listen
for the SIGUSR2 event only once in the application, since it will be emitted twice; the
first SIGUSR2 is for our application's use, while the second is for nodemon's use.
Since nodemon listens for this same event, you donâ€™t want to capture it each time, thus
preventing nodemon from working properly.

/* Tip: To kill a process running on port 3000 in case you have an error stating that a process is using
        that port: fuser 3000/tcp to view the PID, fuser -k 3000/tcp to kill the process */
